# `bnm`: Bayesian Network Metrics

`bnm` is a Python library for evaluating, comparing, and visualising
DAGs, CPDAGs, and PAGs — descriptive structural metrics, comparative
metrics including SHD, HD, F1, and SID, and Markov-blanket-scoped
analysis, with optional graphviz and plotly visualisations.

`bnm` is part of the [constraint-based causal discovery
suite](https://github.com/averinpa/constraint-based-causal-discovery-suite)
alongside `cbcd` (algorithms), `citk` (CI tests), and `dagsampler`
(simulator). Any object satisfying the `bnm.GraphLike` Protocol —
including `cbcd`'s `DAG`, `CPDAG`, and `PAG` instances — drives every
metric without imports between the packages.

## Features

- **Descriptive metrics** — `count_edges`, `count_nodes`,
  `count_colliders`, `count_root_nodes`, `count_leaf_nodes`,
  `count_isolated_nodes`, `count_directed_arcs`,
  `count_undirected_arcs`, `count_bidirected_arcs`,
  `count_circle_edges`, `count_reversible_arcs`, `in_degree`,
  `out_degree`.
- **Comparative metrics** — `shd`, `hd`, `f1`, `precision`, `recall`,
  `true_positives`, `false_positives`, `false_negatives`,
  `count_additions`, `count_deletions`, `count_reversals`.
- **Structural Intervention Distance** — `sid()` after Peters &
  Bühlmann (2015), returning the SID together with bounds for CPDAG
  comparison.
- **Markov-blanket scoping** — `markov_blanket(g, var)` returns a
  sub-`GraphLike` that can be passed back to any metric.
- **Multi-metric comparison** — `compare(true, estimate)` produces a
  `Comparison` exposing every descriptive and comparative metric in
  a single call, with optional pandas export.
- **Visualisation** (optional `viz` extra) — side-by-side graphviz
  comparison with true-positive highlighting and a plotly heatmap
  for SID's incorrect-edge matrix.

## Installation

pip install bnm[networkx]      # + networkx (DiGraph adapter input)
pip install bnm[pandas]        # + pandas (compare().to_dataframe())
```

## Acknowledgements

`bnm` is the Python successor to
[DAGMetrics](https://github.com/averinpa/DAGMetrics), an R package by
the same author for analysing Bayesian networks in microbial
abundance data ([Averin et al.,
2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy15040987)). The metric
definitions — Hamming distance, structural Hamming distance, F1,
additions / deletions / reversals, reversible-arc counts, the
Markov-blanket subgraph construction — are derivative of the R
original.

The Structural Intervention Distance follows [Peters & Bühlmann
(2015)](https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00708); the implementation
operates directly on the int8 endpoint-mark matrix used throughout
the suite.

`bnm` v0.2.x is a full Python rewrite around a canonical `(n, n)`
int8 endpoint-mark matrix matching `cbcd`'s representation.
Cross-package interop with `cbcd` and `dagsampler` is via the
structural `bnm.GraphLike` Protocol — no imports between the
packages.
